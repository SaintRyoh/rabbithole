Systems are made out of:
    Services (which are just interfaces to other systems)
    Signal Handlers
    settings (injected settings)
    components (buttons,keys,rules,layouts)
    Systems (you can actually make systems of systems)

Systems do not have a visual component
for a component to interact with a system, there should be a
corresponding service.
