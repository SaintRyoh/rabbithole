# Rabbithole—The Meta-Window Manager
Enter the Rabbithole.

A revolutionary window manager that takes productivity to a whole new dimension (quite literally). Rabbithole is not just another window manager—it is a dynamic, fluid, and interactive environment that challenges conventional paradigms of window management. It breathes life into your workspace and transforms the way you interact with your computer.

Built on the robust Awesome WM framework, Rabbithole embraces the philosophy of dynamic workspaces. It allows you to nest virtual workspaces and add or remove displays on-the-fly. With Rabbithole, you don't adjust to your workspace, your workspace adjusts to you.
## What is a Meta-Window Manager?

Rabbithole is the first meta-window manager because it goes beyond traditional window management—it is a philosophy on how we believe windows should be managed. Rabbithole is not just about managing windows; it's about redefining how they can be used to enhance your workflow.
## Features

- **Dynamic Display Management**: Disconnect and reconnect screens on-the-fly, without interrupting your flow. Switch from your multi-monitor setup at work to your home's single screen setup seamlessly.

- **Aesthetically Pleasing Experience**: A polished experience that feels more like a Desktop Environment (DE) than a Window Manager (WM). We believe aesthetics matter, even outside full desktop environments.

- **Streamlined Navigation**: Choose between fully keyboard-driven or mouse-driven navigation. Switching between applications, workspaces, and displays is a breeze with our intuitive controls.

- **Personalization**: With Rabbithole's own Tesseract Theme Engine, add a primary color, select a color theory, and generate your unique and beautiful themes, adhering to Material Design 3 standards and color theory rules.

- **Activities**: Different "Activities" for different projects. Separate your workspaces, projects, and flows into different virtual spaces while maintaining global access to applications you always need—Email, Discord, Signal, always accessible.

- **Centralized Settings**: A neat and centralized settings file that controls everything from theme, to keybindings, to default programs.

- **Quick Program Launch**: Pre-configured rofi lets you launch programs or switch windows/workspaces at lightning speed with its fuzzy search algorithm.

## Ideal For

Rabbithole is ideal for users who:

- Appreciate the power of window managers but don't want to deal with the hassle of customizing from scratch.

- Seek an aesthetically pleasing workspace, but are tired of the rigid, or dated appearance of traditional window managers.

- Want their computer interface to be more than a tool—an extension of their minds, a second brain.

- Frequently switch between different monitor setups and need a workspace that can adjust on-the-fly.

- Desire a streamlined, intuitive workspace that boosts productivity without sacrificing user experience.

What is our vision, you ask?
## The Vision of Rabbithole (Planned Features)

Rabbithole is more than just software—it's a journey into the future of digital spaces, and we have the roadmap charted out. 

With our current version 1.x, we have crafted a promising open beta as our proof-of-concept, which is our first step into this grand adventure. Our intention is not only to showcase the potential of Rabbithole, but also to invite the community into the development process. We are eager to know your thoughts, ideas, and feedback as we strive to fill a distinct, yet unexplored niche that caters to users like us.

As we move towards version 2.x, we have already identified a host of enhancements and features we want to incorporate. We love Awesome WM, but its incompatibility with Wayland and the bugs laden within picom have motivated us to push the boundaries, because we have pushed AWM near its limitations. Even though X isn't disappearing anytime soon, we are setting our sights towards the future of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) interfaces. We have a few options in front of us. But this will likely require programming an entirely new framework from the ground up, or continuing where others have left off. We are open to ideas.

Our grand vision is to morph Rabbithole into an AI-powered virtual interface that offers full compatibility with all of your devices. Be it your mobile, PC, or VR/AR headsets, we aim to provide a seamless, unified, and immersive experience across all platforms.

We see Rabbithole as the ultimate bridge that connects the islands of mobile and desktop computing, culminating in a singular, coherent user experience. Join us in our journey to make this vision a reality.
