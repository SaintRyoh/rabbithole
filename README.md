# Rabbitholeâ€”The Meta-Window Manager
A new kind of window manager which allows you to dynamically nest virtual workspaces and add and remove displays on-the-fly. Built on the Awesome WM framework. Rabbithole aims to be more than just a "rice", it aims to be a new philosophy on how workflows should be managed.
