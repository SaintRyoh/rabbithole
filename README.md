# Rabbithole—The Meta-Window Manager

Enter the Rabbithole, a revolutionary window manager that takes productivity to a whole new dimension (quite literally). Rabbithole is not just another desktop tool—it is a dynamic, fluid, and interactive environment that challenges conventional paradigms of window management. It breathes life into your workspace and transforms the way you interact with your computer.

Built on the robust Awesome WM framework, Rabbithole embraces the philosophy of dynamic workspaces. It allows you to nest virtual workspaces and add or remove displays on-the-fly. With Rabbithole, you don't adjust to your workspace, your workspace adjusts to you.

## Features

- **Dynamic Display Management**: Disconnect and reconnect screens on-the-fly, without interrupting your flow. Switch from your multi-monitor setup at work to your home's single screen setup seamlessly.

- **Aesthetically Pleasing Experience**: A polished experience that feels more like a Desktop Environment (DE) than a Window Manager (WM). We believe aesthetics matter, even outside full desktop environments.

- **Streamlined Navigation**: Choose between fully keyboard-driven or mouse-driven navigation. Switching between applications, workspaces, and displays is a breeze with our intuitive controls.

- **Personalization**: With Rabbithole's own Tesseract Theme Engine, add a primary color, select a color theory, and generate your unique and beautiful themes, adhering to Material Design 3 standards and color theory rules.

- **Activities**: Different "Activities" for different projects. Separate your workspaces, projects, and flows into different virtual spaces while maintaining global access to applications you always need—Email, Discord, Signal, always accessible.

- **Centralized Settings**: A neat and centralized settings file that controls everything from theme, to keybindings, to default programs.

- **Quick Program Launch**: Pre-configured rofi lets you launch programs or switch windows/workspaces at lightning speed with its fuzzy search algorithm.

## Ideal For

Rabbithole is ideal for users who:

- Appreciate the power of window managers but don't want to deal with the hassle of customizing from scratch.

- Seek an aesthetically pleasing workspace, but are tired of the rigid, uninspired designs of traditional window managers.

- Want their computer interface to be more than a tool—an extension of their minds, a second brain.

- Frequently switch between different monitor setups and need a workspace that can adjust on-the-fly.

- Desire a streamlined, intuitive workspace that boosts productivity without sacrificing user experience.

## What is a Meta-Window Manager?

We call Rabbithole a meta-window manager because it goes beyond traditional window management—it is a philosophy on how we believe windows should be managed. Rabbithole is not just about managing windows; it's about redefining how they can be used to enhance your workflow.
